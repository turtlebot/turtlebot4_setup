# Turtlebot4 Setup

Setup scripts and tools for the TurtleBot 4 Raspberry Pi.

Visit the [TurtleBot 4 User Manual](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/software/turtlebot4_setup.html) for more details.

Make sure your CreateÂ® 3 is updated to the `I.*.*` firmware; older versions of the firmware are not compatible with ROS 2 Jazzy.

# Create an image manually

Follow these instructions if you wish to create a Turtlebot4 image manually.

## Create an Ubuntu Image

First install the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

- Insert your SD card into your PC and run the Raspberry Pi Imager. Follow the instructions and install Ubuntu 24.04 Server (64-bit) onto the SD card.
- Ensure your Raspberry Pi 4 is not powered before inserting the flashed SD card.
- You can set up the Raspberry Pi by either connecting it to your network via Ethernet or by using a keyboard and HDMI monitor via a micro HDMI cable.

### Ethernet Setup

- Connect the Raspberry Pi to your Network with an Ethernet cable.
- Boot the Raspberry Pi.
- Find the Raspberry Pi's IP using your router's portal.
- SSH into the Raspberry Pi using the IP address.
```bash
ssh ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```
- The default login is `ubuntu` and password is `ubuntu`. You will be prompted to change your password.

### HDMI Setup

- Connect a keyboard to the Raspberry Pi via USB.
- Connect a monitor to the Raspberry Pi via the HDMI0 port.
- Boot the Raspberry Pi.
- The default login is `ubuntu` and password is `ubuntu`. You will be prompted to change your password.

## Manually configure Wi-Fi

Once you are logged into the Raspberry Pi, configure the Wi-Fi:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```
Add the following lines:
```bash
wifis:
    wlan0:
        optional: true
        access-points:
            "YOUR_WIFI_SSID":
                password: "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
        dhcp4: true
```
Note: Ensure that `wifis:` is aligned with the existing `ethernets:` line. All indentations should be 4 spaces. Do not use tabs.
- Reboot the Raspberry Pi. It should now be connected to your Wi-Fi.
- Find the Raspberry Pi's IP using your router's portal.
- SSH into the Raspberry Pi using the IP address.
```bash
ssh ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

## Download and run the setup script

```
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4_setup/jazzy/scripts/turtlebot4_setup.sh | bash
```

The script will automatically install ROS 2 Jazzy, TurtleBot 4 packages, and other important apt packages. It will also configure the RPi4 to work in a TurtleBot 4. Once complete, the RPi4 should be rebooted with `sudo reboot`. Then, run `turtlebot4-setup` to configure the robot with the setup tool.
